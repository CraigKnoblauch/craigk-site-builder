**Ever since I learned what a software engineer is I've wanted to be one.**

I am deeply passionate about the craft of engineering, specifically tackling unconventional problems that require balancing high-level architecture with low-level execution. However, I believe an effective engineer is motivated by more than just tech. In my life and career, I strive to enhance my consideration of others' perspectives.

> *This site is a collection of my technical projects and development processes, but it's also a space where I document experiences and share the pieces of artistic expression that have spoken to me.*
