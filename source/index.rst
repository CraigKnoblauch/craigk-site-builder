I’m a software engineer with six years of experience navigating the complex, high-stakes environments of aerospace, fintech, and defense. Currently, I lead software development for spacecraft at the U.S. Naval Research Laboratory in Washington, D.C.

I am deeply passionate about the craft of engineering, specifically tackling unconventional problems that require balancing high-level architecture with low-level execution. However, I believe an effective engineer is motivated by more than just tech. In my life and career I strive to enhance my consideration of other's perspectives. 

This site is a collection of my technical projects and development processes, but it's also a space where I document experiences and share the pieces of artistic expression that have spoken to me.
